        <p>
            Designing helps me think creatively and understand how visual elements work together.

            Gaming improves my problem-solving skills and teaches me teamwork and strategy.

        <p>
            Video editing allows me to tell stories using visuals and sound.
        </p>

        <p>
            I practice designing layouts regularly to improve my understanding of spacing and alignment.
        </p>

        <p>
            Playing games also helps me relax and enjoy my free time after studying.
        </p>

            Editing videos teaches me patience and attention to detail.

            The purpose of this long section is to make sure scrolling happens smoothly.
        </p>

        <p>
            As you scroll down, notice how the “My Hobbies” heading stays fixed below the navbar.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the section ends, the heading scrolls away naturally.
        </p>

        <h2>Favorite Foods</h2>
